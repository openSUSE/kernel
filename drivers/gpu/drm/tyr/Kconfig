	  Rust DRM driver for ARM Mali CSF-based GPUs.

	  This driver is for Mali (or Immortalis) Valhall Gxxx GPUs.

	  Note that the Mali-G68 and Mali-G78, while Valhall architecture, will
	  be supported with the panfrost driver as they are not CSF GPUs.

	  if M is selected, the module will be called tyr. This driver is work
	  in progress and may not be functional.
