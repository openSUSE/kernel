	  Enables PCIe card driver for Habana's AI Processors (AIP) that are
	  designed to accelerate Deep Learning inference and training workloads.

	  The driver manages the PCIe devices and provides IOCTL interface for
	  the user to submit workloads to the devices.

	  The user-space interface is described in
	  include/uapi/drm/habanalabs_accel.h

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called habanalabs.

	  Enable NVMe peer-to-peer direct I/O support for Habanalabs AI
	  accelerators.

	  This allows direct data transfers between NVMe storage devices
	  and Habanalabs accelerators without involving system memory,
	  using PCI peer-to-peer DMA capabilities.

	  Requirements:
	  - CONFIG_PCI_P2PDMA=y
	  - NVMe device and Habanalabs accelerator under same PCI root complex
	  - IOMMU disabled or in passthrough mode
	  - Hardware supporting PCI P2P DMA

	  If unsure, say N
