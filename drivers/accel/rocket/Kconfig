	  Choose this option if you have a Rockchip SoC that contains a
	  compatible Neural Processing Unit (NPU), such as the RK3588. Called by
	  Rockchip either RKNN or RKNPU, it accelerates inference of neural
	  networks.

	  The interface exposed to userspace is described in
	  include/uapi/drm/rocket_accel.h and is used by the Rocket userspace
	  driver in Mesa3D.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rocket.
