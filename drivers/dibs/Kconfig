	  Direct Internal Buffer Sharing (DIBS)
	  A communication method that uses common physical (internal) memory
	  for synchronous direct access into a remote buffer.

	  Select this option to provide the abstraction layer between
	  dibs devices and dibs clients like the SMC protocol.
	  The module name is dibs.

	  DIBS_LO enables the creation of an software-emulated dibs device
	  named lo which can be used for transferring data when communication
	  occurs within the same OS. This helps in convenient testing of
	  dibs clients, since dibs loopback is independent of architecture or
	  hardware.
