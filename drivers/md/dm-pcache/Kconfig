	  PCACHE provides a mechanism to use persistent memory (e.g., CXL persistent memory,
	  DAX-enabled devices) as a high-performance cache layer in front of
	  traditional block devices such as SSDs or HDDs.

	  PCACHE is implemented as a kernel module that integrates with the block
	  layer and supports direct access (DAX) to persistent memory for low-latency,
	  byte-addressable caching.

	  Note: This feature is experimental and should be tested thoroughly
	  before use in production environments.

	  If unsure, say 'N'.
