	  If you have a network (Ethernet) device belonging to this class,
	  say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question does not directly affect
	  the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions regarding SpacemiT devices. If you say Y, you will
	  be asked for your specific chipset/driver in the following questions.

	  This driver supports the Ethernet MAC in the SpacemiT K1 SoC.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called k1_emac.
