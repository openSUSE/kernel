How to compile perf for Android
===============================

There are two ways to build perf and run it on Android:

- Method 1: Build perf with static linking. See Build.txt, section
  "4) Cross compilation" for how to build a static perf binary.

- Method 2: Download the Android NDK and use the bundled Clang to
  build perf. See Build.txt, section "5) Build with clang" for details.
