KSelfTest RISC-V
================

- These tests are riscv specific and so not built or run but just skipped
  completely when env-variable ARCH is found to be different than 'riscv'.

- Holding true the above, RISC-V KSFT tests can be run within the
  KSelfTest framework using standard Linux top-level-makefile targets:

      $ make TARGETS=riscv kselftest-clean
      $ make TARGETS=riscv kselftest

      or

      $ make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=riscv \
		INSTALL_PATH=<your-installation-path> install

      or, alternatively, only specific riscv/ subtargets can be picked:

      $ make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=riscv RISCV_SUBTARGETS="mm vector" \
		INSTALL_PATH=<your-installation-path> install

   Further details on building and running KSFT can be found in:
     Documentation/dev-tools/kselftest.rst
