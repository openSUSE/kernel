Flash Update
============

The ``zl3073x`` driver implements support for flash update using the
``devlink-flash`` interface. It supports updating the device flash using a
combined flash image ("bundle") that contains multiple components (firmware
parts and configurations).

During the flash procedure, the standard firmware interface is not available,
so the driver unregisters all DPLLs and associated pins, and re-registers them
once the flash procedure is complete.

The driver does not support any overwrite mask flags.
