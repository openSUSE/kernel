title: Open PIC Interrupt Controller

maintainers:

description:
  This binding specifies what properties must be available in the device tree
  representation of an Open PIC compliant interrupt controller.  This binding is
  based on the binding defined for Open PIC in [1] and is a superset of that
  binding.

      - items:
          - const: fsl,mpic

  '#interrupt-cells':
    description:
      A value of 4 means that interrupt specifiers contain the interrupt-type or
      type-specific information cells.
    enum: [ 2, 4 ]

  pic-no-reset:
    description: Indicates the PIC shall not be reset during runtime initialization.
    type: boolean

  single-cpu-affinity:
    description:
      If present, non-IPI interrupts will be routed to a single CPU at a time.
    type: boolean

  last-interrupt-source:
    description:
      Some MPICs do not correctly report the number of hardware sources in the
      global feature registers. This value, if specified, overrides the value
      read from MPIC_GREG_FEATURE_LAST_SRC.
