title: Realtek RTL I2C Controller

maintainers:
  - Chris Packham <chris.packham@alliedtelesis.co.nz>

description:
  RTL9300 SoCs have two I2C controllers. Each of these has an SCL line (which
  if not-used for SCL can be a GPIO). There are 8 common SDA lines that can be
  assigned to either I2C controller.
  RTL9310 SoCs have equal capabilities but support 12 common SDA lines which
  can be assigned to either I2C controller.
