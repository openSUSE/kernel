Kernel driver sa67mcu
=====================

Supported chips:

   * Kontron sa67mcu

     Prefix: 'sa67mcu'

     Datasheet: not available

Authors: Michael Walle <mwalle@kernel.org>

Description
-----------

The sa67mcu is a board management controller which also exposes a hardware
monitoring controller.

The controller has two voltage and one temperature sensor. The values are
hold in two 8 bit registers to form one 16 bit value. Reading the lower byte
will also capture the high byte to make the access atomic. The unit of the
volatge sensors are 1mV and the unit of the temperature sensor is 0.1degC.

Sysfs entries
-------------

The following attributes are supported.

======================= ========================================================
in0_label		"VDDIN"
in0_input		Measured VDDIN voltage.

in1_label		"VDD_RTC"
in1_input		Measured VDD_RTC voltage.

temp1_input		MCU temperature. Roughly the board temperature.
