Sysfs entries
-------------

The following attributes are supported:

fan1_input
  Read Only. Reads current fan RPM.

pwm1_enable
  Read/Write. Enable manual fan control. Write "0" to disable control and run
  at full speed. Write "1" to set to manual, write "2" to let the EC control
  decide fan speed. Read this attribute to see current status.

  NBï¼šIn consideration of the safety of the device, when setting to manual mode,
  the pwm speed will be set to the maximum value (255) by default. You can set
  a different value by writing pwm1 later.

pwm1
  Read/Write. Read this attribute to see current duty cycle in the range
  [0-255]. When pwm1_enable is set to "1" (manual) write any value in the
  range [0-255] to set fan speed.

  NB: Many boards (except listed under wm2 above) don't support reading the
  current pwm value in auto mode. That will just return EOPNOTSUPP. In manual
  mode it will always return the real value.
