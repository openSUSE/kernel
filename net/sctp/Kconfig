	  Stream Control Transmission Protocol

	  From RFC 2960 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2960.txt>.

	  "SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a
	  connectionless packet network such as IP.  It offers the following
	  services to its users:

	  -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data,
	  -- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size,
	  -- sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams,
	  with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user
	  messages,
	  -- optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP
	  packet, and
	  -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-
	  homing at either or both ends of an association."

	  To compile this protocol support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called sctp. Debug messages are handled by the
	  kernel's dynamic debugging framework.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	help
	  If you say Y, this will enable debugging support for counting the
	  type of objects that are currently allocated.  This is useful for
	  identifying memory leaks. This debug information can be viewed by
	  'cat /proc/net/sctp/sctp_dbg_objcnt'

	  If unsure, say N

	help
	  This option sets the default SCTP cookie authentication method, for
	  when a method hasn't been explicitly selected via the
	  net.sctp.cookie_hmac_alg sysctl.

	  If unsure, choose the default (HMAC-SHA256).
