 * bcm2712-rpi-5-b-ovl-rp1.dts is the overlay-ready DT which will make
 * the RP1 driver to load the RP1 dtb overlay at runtime, while
 * bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dts (this file) is the fully defined one (i.e. it
 * already contains RP1 node, so no overlay is loaded nor needed).
 * This file is intended to host the override nodes for the RP1 peripherals,
 * e.g. to declare the phy of the ethernet interface or the custom pin setup
 * for several RP1 peripherals.
 * This in turn is due to the fact that there's no current generic
 * infrastructure to reference nodes (i.e. the nodes in rp1-common.dtsi) that
 * are not yet defined in the DT since they are loaded at runtime via overlay.
 * All other nodes that do not have anything to do with RP1 should be added
 * to the included bcm2712-rpi-5-b-ovl-rp1.dts instead.
